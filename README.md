> Your music taste, understood over time.

## Local Spotify setup

## Overview

Medley is a personal music companion that learns how *you* experience music.

Instead of trying to recommend songs based only on genres or listening history, Medley builds a model of your musical preferences, emotional associations, and listening contexts. Over time, it develops an understanding of which songs work best for different moods and activities, helping keep your playlists fresh without requiring constant manual curation.

Spotify remains the player. Medley becomes the intelligence behind the playlists.

## Motivation

Most music recommendation systems answer questions like:

* "What songs are similar to this?"
* "What do people with similar tastes enjoy?"

Those are useful, but they don't answer the question that matters most:

> **"What do I want to hear right now?"**

A favorite song can become stale after being played repeatedly, while an older song can suddenly become the perfect choice weeks later. Likewise, two songs may sound similar musically, but only one carries the personal meaning or emotional connection that makes it resonate.

Medley is built around the idea that great recommendations come from understanding both the music and the listener.

## Core Ideas

### Musical Understanding

Every song can be described by the characteristics that make it memorable.

Examples include:

* Prominent vocal hooks
* Bass lines and grooves
* Guitar riffs
* Instrumentation
* Harmonic moments
* Emotional intensity
* Genre and overall mood

Rather than reducing music to a single genre, Medley attempts to capture the elements that actually define a song's character.

---

### Personal Meaning

Music is more than sound.

Songs become connected to:

* People
* Memories
* Movies and television
* Places
* Relationships
* Accomplishments
* Different periods of life

These personal associations are often just as important as the music itself.

A song isn't only enjoyable because of how it sounds—it is also enjoyable because of what it represents.

---

### Context Matters

The best song depends on what you're doing.

A track that is perfect while driving may be distracting while working.

Medley learns how songs perform in different situations such as:

* Working
* Studying
* Driving
* Exercising
* Relaxing
* Social settings

---

## Playlist Evolution

Rather than creating playlists once and forgetting them, Medley continuously refines them.

Songs naturally move through a lifecycle:

* Newly discovered
* Active rotation
* Cooling off
* Rediscovered
* Active again

The goal is not to permanently replace songs, but to keep playlists feeling fresh while preserving long-term favorites.

---

## Discovery

Medley doesn't try to search the entire world of music all at once.

Instead, it gradually introduces carefully selected candidates that appear likely to fit your current tastes.

Some become permanent additions.

Others quietly disappear.

Over time, your library evolves naturally.

---

## Long-Term Vision

Medley aims to build a personal map of your musical world.

Instead of organizing songs only by artist or genre, it organizes them by:

* Musical characteristics
* Emotional qualities
* Personal meaning
* Context
* Listening history
* Current relevance

The result is a living representation of your music taste that changes as you do.

---

## Philosophy

Music is deeply personal.

The goal of Medley is not to replace your taste with an algorithm.

The goal is to understand your taste well enough that finding the right song becomes effortless.

Over time, Medley becomes less of a playlist manager and more of a companion that helps you rediscover old favorites, explore new music, and maintain playlists that evolve alongside your life.
